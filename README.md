## Overview
simple-microservices-GOLANG is a practical demonstration of building scalable, maintainable microservices in Go, emphasizing modular design and secure authentication. It showcases best practices for designing, deploying, and managing interconnected services within a cohesive system.

### Why simple-microservices-GOLANG?
This project facilitates the development of robust microservices architectures with a focus on security and best practices. The core features include:
* **Modular Design:** Break down complex systems into manageable, interconnected services for easier maintenance and scalability.
* **JWT Authentication:** Generate and validate JSON Web Tokens to ensure secure, stateless user verification.
* **Secure API Server:** Implement a protected HTTP API that verifies tokens before granting access to sensitive endpoints.
* **Dependency Management:** Use Go modules for consistent, reliable dependency handling across services.
* **Best Practices:** Demonstrates effective service separation, deployment strategies, and security considerations for microservices in Go.
